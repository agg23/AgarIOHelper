# AgarIOHelper
A set of helper scripts for playing http://Agar.io as a Google Chrome extension.

# Current Functionality
* Light green blobs are edible by your smallest blob
* Red blobs are large enough to eat you
* Dark green blobs can be "split-killed" by you
* Pink/purple blobs can "split-kill" you

# Usage
This extension blocks the main script of Agar.io in order to parse it and load its own.  As such, Agar.io will not automatically load.  Press the puzzle piece icon in the top right corner of Google Chrome to load AgarIOHelper.
